After changing the settings.py I ran python manage.py migrate, I got into an error saying no module named psycopg2, so these are the commands for that

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev
sudo pip install psycopg2

What are the requirements?
1: Interview creation page for admin, selection of participants and start and end time.
	- If any of the selected participants has another interview already scheduled at the moment.
	- If the number of available participants is less than 2, it should show an error message.

2: Interview list page where admin can see all the upcoming interviews.

3: Interview edit page
